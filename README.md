# JokeServer
Multi-threaded server that offers up 5 random jokes and proverbs.

This was a project done in Clark Elliott's CSC435 course at DePaul University. 

I have posted it here to demonstrate code to prospective employers and to become comfortable with using GitHub. 
This code is my own work, with inspiration from Elliott's InetServer code distributed in the course. This work is 
not to be copied for other students' JokeServer projects, as they will risk plagiarism penalties. 

This is a work in progress and I welcome comments and suggestions to improve it. Specifically, I welcome suggestions
on how to better balance the responsibilities of the client and the server. I chose a rather heavy-client mode, and other
students utilized a UUID for each client and stored information in a HashTable on the server. I may try doing that in 
the future in order to improve. But for the meantime, this project does what it needs to do.
